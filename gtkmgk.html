After his BSEE, he joined the graduate program in Electrical Engineering with a research assistantship. He returned to India in September 1971.  
Since he could not get any job in India at that time, he came back to the US in January 1972 and worked in a medical lab while staying with his uncle until he started with his NASA job on January 22, 1973.

<p>While working for NASA, he received numerous awards and recognition from NASA that included the prestigious "Silver Snoopy" and "Inventions and Contribution" awards.
The "Silver Snoopy" award was for the design and development of NASA's Network Control Center and the "Inventions and Contributions" award was for the development of a 
"Data Distribution System (DDS)" that allowed scientists and researchers from around the world to browse and select their data products of their interest
and get it distributed through the "Space Physics Analysis Network" or create CDs with the data users selected.  This was done before the 
prevalence of the Internet for these types of systems.  The DDS award received on August 2, 1999 included money and a certificate which reads 
"For the creative development of a scientific contribution which has been determined of significant value in the advancement of aerospace technology program of NASA, and is entitled:"
 Another award he received is the Goddard Space Flight Center Group Achievement award on December 12, 1986 theat states
"In recognition of their technical excellence and dedication for completing the first automatic guard processor that was accredited for operation".  
The guard processor on the NASA network is equivalent to the firewall that organizations put on their network connection to the Internet.
This means that Vackachan was recognized for the creation of the first firewall for NASA.  In addition, he received another group achievement award in 1975 for the "Apollo Soyuz Simulation Team"
